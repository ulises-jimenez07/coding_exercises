def lps(str):

    Finds the length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in a given string.

    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backward.

    Args:
        str: The input string.

    Returns:
        The length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
