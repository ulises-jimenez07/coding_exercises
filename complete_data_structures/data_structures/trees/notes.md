# Types of bnicary tree

Full binary
all nodes have 0 or two

perfect binary tree
all nodes have 2 childs
and it ends at the same level

complete binary tree
all nodes have
last level might not be complete

balanced binary tree
all leaves nodes  the depth is the to the root


# Recursive Time complexity

M(n)
when it calls it self the M(n-1)
then O(n)

for multiple calls
$O(branches^{depth})$
